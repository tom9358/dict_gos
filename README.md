This repository contains the files for my goal to make an extension for LibreOffice using Hunspell for Gronings Low Saxon (ISO 639-3: gos). I am still figuring out how to do that.

Note that I do this in my free time, and I have other projects, interests and obligations as well, so progress might be slow and the project could die. So don't hesitate to contact me, and contributions and suggestions are very welcome!

So far I've figured out:
Barebones hunspell only needs a dictionary file to work (the affix file can be empty).

I have some idea of what .aff files can do, but haven't looked into it in depth

LibreOffice requires .oxt files, which are apparently just .zip files. They do need more files - I've never made a LibreOffice extension so I'm still figuring those out.
