Gronings Low Saxon Spelling Dictionary - 2025

Version 0.1

The wordlist is still far from perfect!

After installing the .oxt extension, set your spell-checking language to Gronings in LibreOffice.
The following works:
In the menu: Format -> Character...
Then set Language: to gos (Netherlands) {gos-NL}
Tested and verified that this works with LibreOffice version 24.8.4.2 (X86_64) on Windows 11.

The following is how it should go, but this doesn't work yet:
Menu Tools -> Language -> For All Text -> More... -> Languages and Locales -> Writing Aids
There you should be able to pick Gronings.
It looks like the language doesn't appear there yet..
I suspect it might have to do with the name Gronings not yet being present in some kind of list.
This is something for version 0.2!
