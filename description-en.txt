Gronings Low Saxon Spelling Dictionary - 2025

Version 0.2.1

The wordlist is still far from perfect.
The last update (0.2.1) removed over 250 erroneous words from the wordlist.
It is a work-in-progress, so please visit my github if you'd like to help improve it!

In LibreOffice versions 25.2.3 and newer, Gronings can be selected as the default document language.
This works as follows:
Menu Tools -> Language -> For All Text -> More... -> Languages and Locales -> General
Then under Default Languages for Documents, Western: select `gos (Netherlands) {gos-NL}`.
In the future, this entry will be updated to contain the language name instead of this code.

If this does not work, it is possible that you need to enable Hunspell under Writing Aids:
Menu Tools -> Language -> For All Text -> More... -> Languages and Locales -> Writing Aids -> Edit
There, a Hunspell checkbox for Gronings should be ticked.

In older versions of LibreOffice, the following should work:
In the menu: Format -> Character...
Then set Language: to `gos (Netherlands) {gos-NL}`
I tested that this works with LibreOffice version 24.8.4.2 (X86_64) on Windows 11.
